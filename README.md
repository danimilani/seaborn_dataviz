Scatter Plot: <br>
"Hue" will define a third variable and hue_order will set the order accordingly.<br>
The first variable is Total Bill (x axis), the second variable is Tip (y axis) and the third variable is Smoker (Y/N), shown in the graph by colors: orange or blue.

We can define the colors we want to be shown in the plot by creating a dictionary mapping subgroup:
